This is a lightweight, forward-port fork of QGroundControl that adds three things pilots keep asking for: live manned traffic, fresh icons, and maps that never need the internet.

### ✈️ What’s Extra?

- **FlightRadar24 live feed** – see crewed aircraft around your drone in real time (free FR24 key required).  
- **New icon set** – crisper symbols for both day and night flight decks.  
- **Locally hosted tiles** – cache or self-host maps; fly offline with no feature loss.

Everything else is pure, stable QGC.
